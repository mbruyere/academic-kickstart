However, general performance models, providing insights on how various factors affect a certain performance metric used in the network optimization process, are missing. For the special case of incast, the existing models are analytical models, either tightly coupled with a particular protocol version or speciﬁc to certain empirical data. This paper proposes an SDN-enabled machine-learningbased optimization framework for incast performance optimization in data center networks that leverages learning-based performance modeling. Evaluations based on intensive NS-3 simulations show that we can achieve accurate performance predictions that enable ﬁnding the efﬁcient switch buffer space to achieve optimal incast completion time in different conﬁgurations. We expect this framework to be a building block for autonomous data center network management.},

	abstract = {Traffic optimization and smart buffering are fundamental to achieve both great application performance and resource efficiency in data centers with heterogeneous workloads, including incast and elephant traffics. However, general performance models providing insights on how various factors affect traffic performance metrics needed by these management functions are missing. For the special case of incast, the existing models are analytical ones, either tightly coupled with a particular protocol version or specific to certain empirical data. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes an SDN-enabled machine-learning-based performance modeling approach in data center networks that leverages random forest predictions. Evaluations based on datasets constructed through intensive NS-3 simulations show that we can achieve accurate predictions of incast and elephant performance metrics based on various features. With this performance modeling capability, smart buffering schemes or traffic optimization algorithms could anticipate and efficiently optimize system parameters adjustment to achieve optimal performance continuously in data centers.},

	abstract = {A massive and growing part of Autonomous System (AS)-level traffic exchanges takes place at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). This paper leverages PeeringDB, a database providing a partial but reasonable view of the global interconnection of ASes at IXPs, to model a complex graph enabling the characterization of the key Internet peering players and their interactions over time. We model a PeeringDB snapshot as a weighted directed bipartite graph, called the pDB c-graph, that captures the port size ASes possess at IXPs using available metadata. This novel model of the Internet is shown to picture relevant features of a complex network that groups ASes and IXPs in geographical areas of influence. From this model, we extract central players of public peering such as hypergiant AS content providers and major regional traffic receivers. Most importantly, this graph model opens the way to apply spectral analysis using reduced Google matrix in order to retrieve the intensity of possible interactions between ASes on the basis of pure connectivity information. As an illustration, we retrieve the timely evolution of the peering network to show how the central content and cloud providers have increased their reach to eyeball networks during Covid-19 pandemic.},
